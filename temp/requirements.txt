    Compares it to the list below and gives a percentage
    Filter/search functionality /
    -----Filters by 'Needed', 'In Possession', 'All'

Nice-to-haves

    For elevated permission levels, have an add/edit/delete feature for each vehicle, allowing for changes in the vehicle list and correction of typos
    Filter by backpack/inventory/both with a toggle. Default view is both.
    Would be cool if it were two columns; Something like: User's cards on the left and whats needed on the right?
    Search bar to see others' progress
    Add logic and UI for a showing progress of completionist levels
    -----Completionist x 1 means a person has at least one of every card
    -----Completionist x 2 means a person has at least two of every card
    -----While a person is going for Completionist x 1, also show progress to the next two levels (x2 and x3)
    -----After completionist x 1 is complete, show progress to Completionist x2, x3, and x4
